# PatternMiner

PatternMiner is a set of Python tools for conducting pattern analysis, clustering, and data mining based, in part, on some of the methods described in the Coursera course “Pattern Discovery in Data Mining”. The aim of this project is to add implementations of the algorithms listed below so that other researchers, learners, and enthusiasts have the tools easily available to them.
